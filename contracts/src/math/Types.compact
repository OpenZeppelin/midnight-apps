/**
 * @title Types
 * @dev Shared type definitions for U128 and U256 structs, used by Uint128 and Uint256 modules.
 *
 * These types exist in a separate module to avoid cyclic dependencies between Uint128 and
 * Uint256. U256 is used as a return type for Uint128 operations that may overflow 128 bits
 * (e.g. addition, multiplication), while U256 itself is composed of two U128 values.
 *
 * Import chain:
 * - Types has no external dependencies (base types)
 * - Uint128 imports U128 and U256 from Types
 * - Uint256 imports U128 and U256 from Types
